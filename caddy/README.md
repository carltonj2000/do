# Docker caddy server Front End

A caddy server docker container for proxy'ing the following back-ends:
 - php main site
 - 3 other sub sites

I used linux `screen` command to start virtual terminal with docker 
running in it in the background. Use `screen -ls` to see running
screens and re-attach.
